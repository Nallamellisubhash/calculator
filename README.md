to calculater numeric values
Modular Functions: The code is modular, with separate functions for each basic arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). This modular design enhances readability, maintainability, and reusability of code components.

User Interaction: The main function orchestrates user interaction by displaying a menu, receiving user input for numbers and operation choice, and presenting the result. This approach makes the calculator user-friendly.

Input Validation: The code includes input validation for the operation choice, ensuring that users enter a valid option (1, 2, 3, or 4). This prevents errors due to incorrect input.

Clear Menu Display: The menu is displayed in a clear and concise format, making it easy for users to understand and select their desired operation.

Calculation Execution: The program correctly calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice, executes the calculation, and displays the result. This ensures accurate and predictable behavior.

Potential Improvements:

Consider adding additional error handling for cases where users enter non-numeric values for the numbers.
Enhance the program to handle division by zero gracefully.
Provide an option for users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
Add more advanced mathematical functions or features for a broader range of use cases.
